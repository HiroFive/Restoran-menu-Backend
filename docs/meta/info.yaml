  description: |-
    So this is a document that should be updated with each new route/functionality.
    We have 3 folders: meta, routes, components
    - `meta` folder contains special informational blocks such as *info* or *tags*
    - `routes` folder contains route information. One tag per file. For example *User.yaml* has all routes under *User* tag.
    - `components` contains reusable pieces of docs. Folders are:
      - schemas: models of data
      - responses
      - requests
      - security
      - ...
    If you want to add new meta file, you will need to add it's name to the `finalDefinition`
    If you want to add new route or component, just add a new file that *has the same structure* as others in that folder.
